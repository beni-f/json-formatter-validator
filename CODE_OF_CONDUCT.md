# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of **unacceptable** behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks, insults, or trolling
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without their explicit consent
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, and reject comments, commits, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at \[INSERT CONTACT METHOD\]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders are responsible for determining who meets the criteria for enforcement and the appropriate consequences. However, they must respect the following guidelines:

## 1\. Correction, Warning, and Non-Action

* **Repeat Offenders:** Users with previous warnings who repeat behavior
* **Correction:** Verbal warning with consequences for continued behavior
* **No Action:** Insufficient grounds for action

## 2\. Temporary Ban

* **Repeat Offenders:** Multiple confirmed incidents
* **Duration:** 1 week to 3 months
* **Notification:** Clear reason and duration

## 3\. Permanent Ban

* **Repeat Offenders:** Severe violations or repeated temporary bans
